## WORK IN PROGRESS 

My whole phil:
  * Complex systems penalizes massive step functions
  * Most changes around you have increase in variance but mode stays the same
  * Complexity increases with time but not due to the mean but due to the variance
  * Computational beats analytical solutions
  * Never bet against/ always bet with self-organized criticality 
  * People confuse multiple exponentials with log-normal
  * Human behaviour corresponds to a Kuramoto model of reality
  * Percolation theory is under-studied massively

## Strong opinions weakly held
* Current LMs representations focus on diachronic meaning but not in the synchronic meaning.

In this page, we will be discussing some math terms that are used in machine learning and deep learning that i have no idea about.

## Lipschitz continuity

Given two metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$, a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant $K \geq 0$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$.

Any such $K$ is called a Lipschitz constant for the function $f$. The smallest constant $K$ for which the inequality holds is called the Lipschitz constant of $f$.

Think of a double cone, where the slope of the cone is the Lipschitz constant. The function is Lipschitz continuous if the slope of the cone is bounded.

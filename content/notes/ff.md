##### Add proof about universal approximation theorem

##### Example of why 

##### all activations are not the same 

#### why nn can even model noise

#### What is the role of activation function

##### Add points regularization is a not always the right answer

#### there is always a subset of dimensions containing paths to leave local optima and keep on exploring.


#### Heterogeneous Layer Robustness

#### Layers are not Created Equal

#### Lottery ticket 

#### Neural tangent kernel


#### Infinite width networks 


#### Deterministic NTK

#### Linearized NTK

#### Lazy trainign
